<!-- Introduction -->

## Introduction

**AAGMM** is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning">USB framework</a>. The framework supports the baseline FlexMatch model natively, and for AAGMM experiments we extended and modified that code within the framework. To understand how to run and use the USB framework, please see the <a href="https://usb.readthedocs.io/en/main/">USB docs</a>. All of our extensions to USB can be found in the /semilearn/algorithms/aagmm folder.
